#Ivy's Reflections: Wednesday February 8th - DAY 3


- I found the code review really helpful. It’s a nice reminder to see that there are many different ways to solve a problem.  I My take away from this is that there are 
many different places to add the .lowerCase variable
Alert and Confirm are very similar, one advantage to confirm is that it doesn’t return Null
I need to do some more investigating on logical operators vs booleans.  I’m still a bit hazy on the issue with the OR condition in Michelle’s code

The array exercise that we did was super helpful.  I felt great about arrays before class today, but the examples that we talked about demonstrated just how complex that arrays can get, which is good to keep in mind.

LAB:

My take-aways from today’s lab:
The labs are not just about providing code and building a project.  They are also about sorting through the assignment to determine what kind of code you need and why.  
Loops are tricky.
It’s important to think through what you’re trying to accomplish and why.  Sometimes just being able to articulate this in english will lead you to the best way to express your desired results in coded language.
I discovered that when a for loop is embedded in a while loop, it will continue to run unless you tell it to break from the for loop AND create a false so that it breaks from the while loop as well.
Loops will require lots of practice to nail down.
Calculating each correct answer was easier than I thought.
