#February 9th - Day 4


- Today I learned that functions are pretty simple to make once your code blocks are created.
- I also learnred a lot about formatting from Yuval during our paired programming session.  He is meticulous and it was fantastic to pick up tips from him.
- I learned that it was a quick fix to fix my counter in my about me code.
- In todays lab we were working on code that I thought was running properly.  But after working through today's excercise, I think I may have overlooked some things that were not working in my code.  This was frustrating, but also very helpful to highlight some things that I need to keep in mind next time I'm writing loops or any code for that matter.
- Again, I really enjoyed the code review.  It's super helpful to see how other people solve problems.
- And in lecture, it was very helpful to talk about turning strings into numbers.  I did google it yesterday, but found implementing it to be tricky....so thanks for that.
