#Ivy's Reflections-Day 5



I appreciated the review of how to start/finish each day's lab:
At the end of day for your submission, you push up your branch up to GitHub.
After that (or anytime before the next lab) you should
        - Checkout master (to switch to master)
        - Merge your changes from yesterday
        - Create a pull request from gitHub Repo
        - Merge them to gitHub...And then
        - Pull to master
        - While in master, create a new branch
        - Start work on your new branch for new day lab

- The CSS discussion in class was very helpful:
        - It can be tricky to encorporate a float into your code.
        - You often times have to compensate for them by creating a phantom element in HTML
        - Additionally, it is best practice to adjust width, padding, ect rather than adjusting position(which is likely to cause problems down the line because the computer still thinks it's taking up its' original space, even though ti doesn't appear that way to us)


- Takeaways from Function discussion in Lecture:
        - You can only get one value back from an function 
        - You can have multiple retun statements, but it only reads the first one it sees.
        - once it sees a return, the function ends
        - If you want to get multiple values back from a function you have to represent them as a single valueâ€¦.an array, or something like it.
