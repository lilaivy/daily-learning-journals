#Ivy's Reflections-Day 7


- Today was the first day that I felt comfortable with the stuggle that I felt in lab.  I think that is because I knew exactly what I needed to do and what pieces I needed to do it, I just wasn't quite sure how to put them together...things are coming together.

- I got a lot of practice with the console today to help me to achieve my coding goals.

- It was also really helpful to see what a constructor function actually consists of.
