# Tuesday February 7th Code 201 - Day 2

Day 2 down.  Today's lecture seemed much more assessible to me.  That's probably because we spent more time focusing on code and less time on terminal and git, both of which continue to be the most confusing to me.  I will say that I feel much more comfortable with both than yesterday.
The toughest part for me in lab today was definitely time management....always something that I have to be conscious of, and today was no different.  Just getting up and running was tricky.  It took some time to remember how to create/clone a repo.  The same with creating new files in terminal, and definitely all the steps required to commit.  The good news is, once I actually got to the point of writing code, I felt a lot more confident than yesterday.  And my code worked pretty much straight away!  I continue to look forward to the day when set up, terminal navigation  and commiting code come second nature so that I can focus all of my energy to learning all the ins and outs of JS and CSS.
